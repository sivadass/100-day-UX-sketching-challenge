# 100 Days UX Sketching Challenge

The challenge is about building your own UX-related visual library, and also about creating a habit around sketching.

### How It Works

Krisztina Szerovay will send out 3 objects or concepts related to UX each day for 100 days, and the task is to create a sketch for them. She will also provide her own solutions for the previous day’s exercise. As a result of completing the challenge, you’re going to end up with 300 UX-related visuals drawn by yourself! And it only takes about 5 minutes a day.
